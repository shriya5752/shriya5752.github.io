&lt;p&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s one of those things that feels obvious until you try to explain how it works. then it gets interesting fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i started pulling on this thread after a perfectly ordinary tuesday afternoon where a friend and i typed over each other in a shared doc and nothing broke. that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be as hard as it is. here&amp;rsquo;s why it is, and how google solved it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>understanding shells &amp; commands: because i was lost too (part1)</title><link>https://shriya5752.github.io/blog/first_post1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shriya5752.github.io/blog/first_post1/</guid><description>&lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/Understanding-Shells-Commands-Because-I-Was-Lost-Too-2f42da7f7c25805383b2e2068ea1ca0b" target="_blank" class="notion-btn"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;look, i&amp;rsquo;ll be honest — i spent way too long just copying and running commands without actually understanding what was happening. everyone around me seemed to know what they were doing in the terminal, and i just&amp;hellip; didn&amp;rsquo;t. i&amp;rsquo;d paste commands, pray they worked, and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the problem? nobody actually explains what a shell &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; before throwing you into it. we all start learning python or java or whatever, and suddenly professors are like &amp;ldquo;yeah just cd into this directory and run this&amp;rdquo; and you&amp;rsquo;re sitting there like&amp;hellip; what&amp;rsquo;s cd? what&amp;rsquo;s a directory? why does this black window exist?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
