      <description>&lt;p&gt;somewhere in google&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure, right now, thousands of people are typing into the same documents simultaneously. cursors flying, edits overlapping, nobody waiting for anyone else. and somehow — through what looks like pure coordination magic, everyone ends up with the same document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s one of those things that feels obvious until you try to explain how it works. then it gets interesting fast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i started pulling on this thread after a perfectly ordinary tuesday afternoon where a friend and i typed over each other in a shared doc and nothing broke. that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be as hard as it is. here&amp;rsquo;s why it is, and how google solved it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
